# graph-spectrum
This is a collection of scripts in python about algorithms for analyzing, vizualizing and generating graphs. 

## First Use Case
The Script "generateanddisplayrandomgraph.py" generates a graph and prints the graph in a diagram. In parallel in the console it can be observed which nodes are fuzzy similar. I.g. a line like "5 vs. 6: 0.0" indicates, that those nodes have the same "context" in which they appear.

Execute with (python3 necessary):
```
python generateanddisplayrandomgraph.py
```

Please use the install.sh file to install necessary python libs.
